                    This essay will discuss topics covered in the course,
                    reflecting on markup languages, the ethics of open access,
                    and the value of cultural digitization.

                    <h2>1. TEI and XML</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML and XML are both mark-up languages, and there are
                        other mark-up languages such as YAML. Different from
                        HTML, XML is only targeted at storing text information,
                        preserving the hierarchical traits of the text, but not
                        containing anything about displaying the text.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        XML is used in many places in today’s digital lives of
                        people. For instance, Files like .docx, .xlsx, .pptx are
                        essentially ZIP archives containing many XML files.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        If you rename a .docx file to .zip and extract it, you
                        will find a collection of XML files.

                    <h2>2. Open Access – The Internet’s Own Boy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I learnt a lot from the problem discussed in this film,
                        which I think is about the accessibility of research
                        journal articles, which is also related to copyright
                        issues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After watching the film and engaging in our class, my
                        understanding now is that the copyright of the journal
                        articles usually belong to the publishers (e.g.
                        Elsevier, JSTOR). Am I right? Then the question is
                        whether it is fair for the publishers to charge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The current inequality in access of knowledge for the
                        public and scholars in educational institutions is
                        because the publishers charge. Scholars in educational
                        institutions having privilege is because the
                        institutions have paid. However, I agree that we should
                        find a better model for the society to give more equal
                        access to knowledge to everyone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I know that some scholars use funding to pay for their
                        publications to be open source. Beyond journal articles,
                        I also have a concern about published books. Should
                        published books be free to the public as well? What are
                        the differences between published books and journal
                        articles? Websites like Z-library are important for
                        students who are frightened by the high prices of books,
                        but many of them are illegal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a consumer of intellectual resources, such as books,
                        journals, music, films, I would prefer them to be free,
                        and I would enjoy using special technical skills to
                        obtain them, but I wouldn't dare to circulate them in
                        fear of legal risks.

                    <h2>3. Digitisation in GLAM Section</h2>
                    <p>
                        The digitisation in GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries,
                        Archives, and Museums) provides many benefits. For
                        example, it helps with scholarly studies. In the past
                        year, I have been obsessed with two research works by a
                        group of visualisation (as a part of computer science)
                        researchers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Their works <em>OldVisOnline</em> and
                        <em>ZuantuSet</em> retrieves images about historical
                        visualisations from major digital collections around the
                        world, and build them as a database. Their work targeted
                        at the history of visualisation can be viewed in the
                        discipline of history of science. Such works cannot be
                        realistic without great digitisation works by the
                        museums beforehand.
