                    An essay on TEI, Open Access, and GLAM Digitisation
                </p>
                <hr />
            </header>

            <article>
                <p class="intro">
                    This essay will discuss topics in the course, reflecting on
                    TEI-XML and other text encoding scenarios, the problems and
                    controversy of open access, and digitisation in the GLAM
                    sector.
                </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. TEI and XML</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML and XML are both mark-up languages, and there are
                        other mark-up languages such as YAML. Different from
                        HTML, which is based on XML, XML is only targeted at
                        storing text information, preserving the hierarchical
                        traits of the text, but not containing anything about
                        displaying the text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        XML is used in many places in today’s digital lives of
                        people. For instance, files like <code>.docx</code>,
                        <code>.xlsx</code>, <code>.pptx</code> are essentially
                        ZIP archives containing many XML files. If you rename a
                        <code>.docx</code> file to <code>.zip</code> and extract
                        it, you will find a collection of XML files.
                    </p>

                    <p>Beyond TEI-XML, there are other encoding frameworks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>EpiDoc</strong> – an XML standard built on
                            TEI, used for inscriptions, papyri, and ancient
                            documents.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>MEI (Music Encoding Initiative)</strong> – a
                            TEI-like encoding for music notation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong
                                >IIIF (International Image Interoperability
                                Framework)</strong
                            >
                            – not a mark-up language, but a standard enabling
                            rich digital presentation of manuscripts and images
                            across institutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong
                                >YAML / JSON for born-digital archives</strong
                            >
                            – used increasingly in digital asset management
                            systems because they are lightweight and
                            machine-friendly. Reimann et al. (2024) notably
                            argue that capturing born-digital data, such as
                            online forum threads with emojis and upvotes,
                            requires custom schemas that reflect the nested,
                            tree-like structure of digital conversations rather
                            than traditional linear text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Text mining corpora</strong> – often encoded
                            in stand-off annotation formats rather than TEI to
                            allow multiple layers of annotation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        TEI preserves scholarly nuance, but it is
                        labour-intensive, which means large-scale TEI projects
                        are more likely to be accomplished by well-resourced
                        institutions.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the standards within TEI are not static.
                        While the flexibility of TEI is a strength, maintaining
                        the ODD (One Document Does it All) processor—which
                        generates schemas and documentation—has proven
                        difficult, leading to recent initiatives like "ATOP" to
                        rebuild ODD processing from scratch (Bauman et al.,
                        2024). Additionally, TEI continues to evolve socially;
                        Beshero-Bondar et al. (2024) highlight recent updates to
                        the guidelines that move away from binary, ISO-standard
                        definitions of sex and gender, allowing for more
                        culturally accurate and inclusive personography in
                        digital editions.

                        To visualise how this semantic tagging works in
                        practice, I have included an interactive example below
                        using Percy Bysshe Shelley's <em>Ozymandias</em>:

                    <h2>2. Open Access – The Internet’s Own Boy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I learnt a lot from the problem discussed in this film,
                        which I think is about the accessibility of research
                        journal articles, which is also related to copyright
                        issues. After watching the film and engaging in our
                        class, my understanding now is that the copyright of
                        journal articles usually belongs to the publishers (e.g.
                        Elsevier, JSTOR). Am I right? Then the question is
                        whether it is fair for the publishers to charge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current inequality in access to knowledge for the
                        public and scholars in educational institutions is in
                        part because publishers charge for access. Scholars in
                        institutions have privileged access because their
                        institutions subscribe. I agree that we should find a
                        better model to give more equal access to knowledge to
                        everyone. I also know that some scholars use funding to
                        pay APCs so their publications can be open access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the "Gold Open Access" model, which relies on
                        Article Processing Charges (APCs), introduces new
                        inequities. Papillon et al. (2019) argue that while this
                        solves the readability issue, it essentially transfers
                        the cost barrier from the reader to the author. This
                        disenfranchises researchers in the humanities and social
                        sciences who often lack large grants, as well as junior
                        scholars and those in the Global South. A purely
                        APC-driven model risks creating a "pay-to-publish"
                        system where only well-funded voices are heard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond journal articles, I am also concerned about the
                        status of books in the open-access debate. While journal
                        articles typically generate no income for their
                        authors—who are usually salaried researchers—books
                        belong to a different economic and labour structure.
                        Monographs often represent years of work, and authors
                        may rely, even modestly, on royalties as part of their
                        income. This makes the ethics of providing free access
                        to books more complicated than those surrounding journal
                        articles. At the same time, students and independent
                        learners frequently struggle with the high cost of
                        academic books, which partly explains the appeal of
                        websites like Z-Library, even though many of these
                        platforms operate illegally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, Open Access in the GLAM sector faces unique
                        challenges regarding what constitutes a "research
                        output." Rees Koerner and Ackrell (2025) note that while
                        universities produce papers, museums produce
                        exhibitions, labels, and engagement activities.
                        Traditional repositories are ill-equipped to capture
                        these ephemeral, multi-modal outputs, requiring new
                        infrastructure to make museum research truly open and
                        transparent.

                    <p>
                        My own experience reflects this tension: as a consumer
                        of intellectual resources, I appreciate the
                        accessibility that piracy provides, yet I remain
                        cautious about participating in it because of the legal
                        risks and the potential impact on authors whose
                        livelihood may depend on book sales. These differences
                        suggest that open access cannot adopt a single, uniform
                        model, and that books require a more nuanced and
                        sustainable approach.

                    <h2>3. Digitisation in the GLAM sector</h2>
                    <p>
                        The digitisation in GLAMs provides many benefits. For
                        example, it helps with scholarly studies. In the past
                        year, I have been obsessed with two research works by a
                        group of visualisation (as a part of computer science)
                        researchers. Their works <em>OldVisOnline</em> and
                        <em>ZuantuSet</em> retrieve images about historical
                        visualisations from major digital collections around the
                        world and build them as a database.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Zhang et al. (2023) note in their creation of
                        <em>OldVisOnline</em> that historical visualizations are
                        often scattered across disparate institutions
                        (libraries, museums, archives) with inconsistent
                        metadata, making a unified dataset crucial for studying
                        the visual history of science. Furthermore, Mei et al.
                        (2025) highlight a critical gap in digital humanities:
                        the underrepresentation of non-Western materials. Their
                        <em>ZuantuSet</em> specifically addresses Chinese
                        historical visualizations, challenging the Eurocentric
                        bias often found in generalist datasets and requiring
                        specific taxonomy adjustments to capture unique artistic
                        styles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, despite thirty years of investment, only about
                        22% of heritage collections in Europe are digitized
                        (Terras, 2022). Crucially, even when objects are
                        digitized, they are often difficult to find or use due
                        to poor metadata practices. Lim and Liew (2011) found
                        that while many NZ institutions use Simple Dublin Core,
                        the lack of technical metadata and the reliance on
                        proprietary systems creates silos where data cannot be
                        easily shared or harvested. Without interoperable
                        metadata, digitized items effectively remain invisible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation itself encompasses a wide range of
                        technical methods. Traditional techniques include
                        <strong>2D scanning</strong> of flat objects
                        (manuscripts, prints),
                        <strong>high‑resolution photography</strong> for
                        artworks, and <strong>multispectral imaging</strong>
                        used to reveal erased or faded text. More advanced
                        projects use
                        <strong>photogrammetry</strong>, which reconstructs 3D
                        geometry from many photographs, and
                        <strong>structured‑light</strong> or
                        <strong>laser scanning</strong>, which produce highly
                        accurate 3D meshes of objects such as sculptures,
                        scientific instruments, or archaeological artefacts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While these technologies are impressive, they are not
                        without limitations. Tausch et al. (2019) describe the
                        immense challenges of automating 3D digitization for
                        mass collections, particularly for objects with
                        reflective surfaces like gold, which require specialized
                        polarization techniques. Furthermore, the accessibility
                        of the resulting images is often overstated. Valeonti et
                        al. (2019) note that many "Open Access" museums still
                        provide only low-resolution images or wrap their content
                        in cumbersome download forms to track usage, creating
                        friction that discourages reuse.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation is often legally blocked because scanning
                        or copying an artwork, book, or photograph constitutes
                        making a “copy” under copyright law. GLAM institutions
                        often cannot digitise works unless they can find (or
                        pay) the copyright holders. Because of these
                        constraints, institutions sometimes digitise items based
                        on the ease of rights clearance rather than cultural
                        significance. Coad (2019) describes this phenomenon as
                        the "digital skew," where our online cultural memory is
                        dominated by older, public domain works, while modern
                        history remains hidden behind copyright walls. This
                        creates a distorted view of history where the "digital
                        public domain" does not accurately reflect our recent
                        past.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation also enables
                        <strong>digital repatriation</strong>, which can be a
                        powerful tool for indigenous communities seeking access
                        to cultural artefacts that cannot be physically
                        returned.

                        Such works cannot be realistic without the extensive
                        digitisation efforts undertaken by museums and cultural
                        institutions. However, we must remain critical of the
                        process, ensuring that digitization efforts prioritize
                        data quality, interoperability, and legal frameworks
                        that allow for true accessibility, rather than creating
                        new digital silos.
