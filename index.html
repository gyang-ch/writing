            <article>
                <p class="intro">
                    This essay reflects on key topics covered in the course
                    DH6033. While the curriculum covered a broad range of
                    concepts, this discussion will focus on three specific
                    areas: TEI-XML and text encoding frameworks, the
                    complexities and controversies surrounding Open Access, and
                    digitisation practices within the GLAM (Galleries,
                    Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector. These topics were
                    selected due to their specific relevance to my interests and
                    the significant scholarly debates they continue to generate
                    within the field.
                </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. TEI and XML</h2>
                    <p>
                        Markup languages form the backbone of digital text
                        processing. While HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
                        focuses on the presentation and display of data, XML
                        (eXtensible Markup Language) is designed specifically
                        for the storage and transport of structured data,
                        preserving the hierarchical semantic traits of the text
                        rather than its visual appearance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        XML is ubiquitous in modern digital infrastructure,
                        often operating invisibly to the end user. For instance,
                        common file formats such as <code>.docx</code>,
                        <code>.xlsx</code>, and <code>.pptx</code> are
                        essentially ZIP archives containing a collection of XML
                        files that describe the document's content and
                        structure. If one were to rename a
                        <code>.docx</code> file to <code>.zip</code> and extract
                        it, the underlying XML architecture becomes visible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Digital Humanities, the Text Encoding Initiative
                        (TEI) is the de facto standard for XML implementation.
                        However, the landscape of encoding frameworks is
                        diverse, with specific standards developed to address
                        unique material constraints:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>MEI (Music Encoding Initiative)</strong> – A
                            community-driven effort to define a TEI-like
                            encoding scheme for music notation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong
                                >IIIF (International Image Interoperability
                                Framework)</strong
                            >
                            – While not a markup language itself, this standard
                            enables the rich digital presentation and
                            interoperability of manuscripts and images across
                            disparate institutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong
                                >YAML / JSON for born-digital archives</strong
                            >
                            – Lightweight, machine-friendly formats increasingly
                            used in digital asset management. Reimann et al.
                            (2024) notably argue that capturing born-digital
                            data—such as online forum threads replete with
                            emojis and upvotes—often requires custom schemas
                            that reflect the nested, tree-like structure of
                            digital conversations, a complexity that traditional
                            linear text encoding can struggle to capture
                            effectively.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Text mining corpora</strong> – These are
                            often encoded using stand-off annotation formats
                            rather than embedded TEI to allow for multiple,
                            overlapping layers of interpretation without
                            breaking the XML hierarchy.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        TEI preserves scholarly nuance, but it is
                        labour-intensive, which means large-scale TEI projects
                        are more likely to be accomplished by well-resourced
                        institutions.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, TEI is not a static standard; it evolves to
                        meet both technical and social challenges. Bauman et al.
                        (2024) highlight the technical difficulties in
                        maintaining the ODD (One Document Does it All)
                        processor—the system that generates schemas and
                        documentation—noting that the complexity of the existing
                        TEI Stylesheets has necessitated new initiatives like
                        "ATOP" to rebuild processing tools from scratch.
                        Simultaneously, the guidelines evolve to reflect
                        changing cultural values. Beshero-Bondar et al. (2024)
                        detail recent revisions to the guidelines that move away
                        from binary, ISO-standard definitions of sex and gender,
                        empowering encoders to use more culturally accurate and
                        inclusive personography in digital editions.

                        To visualise how this semantic tagging works in
                        practice, I have included an interactive example below
                        using Percy Bysshe Shelley's <em>Ozymandias</em>:

                    <h2>2. Open Access – The Internet’s Own Boy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The documentary <em>The Internet’s Own Boy</em> serves
                        as a poignant introduction to the structural tensions
                        inherent in academic knowledge production. It
                        illuminates the often-restrictive nature of copyright
                        laws governing scholarly journal articles—rights that
                        typically reside not with the creators of the knowledge,
                        but with commercial publishers such as Elsevier and
                        JSTOR. This raises a fundamental ethical question: is it
                        just for publishers to commodify knowledge that is
                        largely produced through public funding and academic
                        labour?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current landscape creates a tiered system of
                        information privilege. While those affiliated with
                        well-funded institutions enjoy seamless access via
                        library subscriptions, the general public and
                        independent scholars remain effectively locked out.
                        While the move toward Open Access seeks to remedy this,
                        the transition is fraught with economic complexity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, the "Gold Open Access" model, which often
                        relies on Article Processing Charges (APCs), risks
                        introducing new forms of inequity. Papillon et al.
                        (2019) argue that while this model solves the issue of
                        accessibility for the reader, it essentially transfers
                        the financial barrier to the author. This shift
                        threatens to disenfranchise researchers in the
                        humanities and social sciences who often lack large
                        grants, as well as junior scholars and those in the
                        Global South, potentially creating a "pay-to-publish"
                        system where only well-funded voices can afford to be
                        open.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the debate requires nuance when
                        distinguishing between different formats of scholarship.
                        While journal articles typically generate no direct
                        income for their authors, monographs operate within a
                        different economic structure. Books often represent
                        years of labour, and their authors may rely on royalties
                        as a component of their livelihood. Consequently, the
                        ethics of mandating free access to books are more
                        complicated than those surrounding journal articles.
                        Yet, the high cost of academic monographs continues to
                        drive students and independent learners toward "shadow
                        libraries" like Z-Library, despite the legal and ethical
                        grey areas they occupy.

                    <p>
                        The definition of what constitutes a "research output"
                        further complicates the application of Open Access
                        principles, particularly within the GLAM sector. Rees
                        Koerner and Ackrell (2025) note that while universities
                        primarily produce textual publications, museums generate
                        multi-modal outputs such as exhibitions, gallery labels,
                        and engagement activities. Traditional digital
                        repositories are often ill-equipped to capture these
                        ephemeral outputs, necessitating new infrastructure to
                        ensure that museum research is as transparent and
                        accessible as its academic counterpart.

                        This distinction creates a personal tension: as a
                        consumer of intellectual resources, I appreciate the
                        immediate accessibility provided by various digital
                        platforms, yet I remain cautious about participating in
                        systems that might economically harm authors of
                        monographs. These differences suggest that Open Access
                        cannot adopt a monolithic model; rather, books and
                        non-traditional outputs require distinct, sustainable
                        approaches that balance accessibility with the economic
                        realities of production.

                    <h2>3. Digitisation in the GLAM sector</h2>
                    <p>
                        The digitisation in GLAMs provides many benefits. For
                        example, it helps with scholarly studies. In the past
                        year, I have been obsessed with two research works by a
                        group of visualisation (as a part of computer science)
                        researchers. Their works <em>OldVisOnline</em> and
                        <em>ZuantuSet</em> retrieve images about historical
                        visualisations from major digital collections around the
                        world and build them as a database.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Zhang et al. (2023) note in their creation of
                        <em>OldVisOnline</em> that historical visualizations are
                        often scattered across disparate institutions
                        (libraries, museums, archives) with inconsistent
                        metadata, making a unified dataset crucial for studying
                        the visual history of science. Furthermore, Mei et al.
                        (2025) highlight a critical gap in digital humanities:
                        the underrepresentation of non-Western materials. Their
                        <em>ZuantuSet</em> specifically addresses Chinese
                        historical visualizations, challenging the Eurocentric
                        bias often found in generalist datasets and requiring
                        specific taxonomy adjustments to capture unique artistic
                        styles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, despite thirty years of investment, only about
                        22% of heritage collections in Europe are digitized
                        (Terras, 2022). Crucially, even when objects are
                        digitized, they are often difficult to find or use due
                        to poor metadata practices. Lim and Liew (2011) found
                        that while many NZ institutions use Simple Dublin Core,
                        the lack of technical metadata and the reliance on
                        proprietary systems creates silos where data cannot be
                        easily shared or harvested. Without interoperable
                        metadata, digitized items effectively remain invisible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation itself encompasses a wide range of
                        technical methods. Traditional techniques include
                        <strong>2D scanning</strong> of flat objects
                        (manuscripts, prints),
                        <strong>high‑resolution photography</strong> for
                        artworks, and <strong>multispectral imaging</strong>
                        used to reveal erased or faded text. More advanced
                        projects use
                        <strong>photogrammetry</strong>, which reconstructs 3D
                        geometry from many photographs, and
                        <strong>structured‑light</strong> or
                        <strong>laser scanning</strong>, which produce highly
                        accurate 3D meshes of objects such as sculptures,
                        scientific instruments, or archaeological artefacts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While these technologies are impressive, they are not
                        without limitations. Tausch et al. (2019) describe the
                        immense challenges of automating 3D digitization for
                        mass collections, particularly for objects with
                        reflective surfaces like gold, which require specialized
                        polarization techniques. Furthermore, the accessibility
                        of the resulting images is often overstated. Valeonti et
                        al. (2019) note that many "Open Access" museums still
                        provide only low-resolution images or wrap their content
                        in cumbersome download forms to track usage, creating
                        friction that discourages reuse.

                    <p>
                        Digitisation is often legally blocked because scanning
                        or copying an artwork, book, or photograph constitutes
                        making a “copy” under copyright law. GLAM institutions
                        often cannot digitise works unless they can find (or
                        pay) the copyright holders. Because of these
                        constraints, institutions sometimes digitise items based
                        on the ease of rights clearance rather than cultural
                        significance. Coad (2019) describes this phenomenon as
                        the "digital skew," where our online cultural memory is
                        dominated by older, public domain works, while modern
                        history remains hidden behind copyright walls. This
                        creates a distorted view of history where the "digital
                        public domain" does not accurately reflect our recent
                        past.

                        A striking example of digitisation unlocking
                        cross-cultural history is the collection of early Qing
                        dynasty plant paintings held at the British Library.
                        Recently analysed by Coulton (2025), these images were
                        acquired in Xiamen (Amoy) around 1698–1702 by commercial
                        travellers like James Cuninghame. Unlike later 'export
                        art,' these 2,400 paintings represent a unique synthesis
                        of Chinese <em>bencao</em> (materia medica) and
                        <em>huaniaohua</em> (flower-and-bird) traditions,
                        created by local artists—including a 'Dr
                        Bun-ko'—specifically for European naturalists like Sir
                        Hans Sloane. While they have languished in physical
                        storage for centuries, IIIF technology now allows us to
                        examine the delicate 'boneless' style brushwork and
                        original Chinese nomenclature in minute detail,
                        revealing a complex network of early modern scientific
                        exchange that was previously difficult to access.

                        Such works cannot be realistic without the extensive
                        digitisation efforts undertaken by museums and cultural
                        institutions. However, we must remain critical of the
                        process, ensuring that digitization efforts prioritize
                        data quality, interoperability, and legal frameworks
                        that allow for true accessibility, rather than creating
                        new digital silos.
