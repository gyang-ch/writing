            <h1>Thoughts on Topics in the Digital Humanities Course</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">An essay on TEI, Open Access, and GLAM Digitisation</p>
            <hr>
        </header>

        <article>
            <p class="intro">This essay will discuss topics covered in the course, reflecting on markup languages, the ethics of open access, and the value of cultural digitization.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>1. TEI and XML</h2>
                <p>HTML and XML are both mark-up languages, and there are other mark-up languages such as YAML. Different from HTML, XML is only targeted at storing text information, preserving the hierarchical traits of the text, but not containing anything about displaying the text.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    XML is used in many places in today’s digital lives of people. For instance, Files like .docx, .xlsx, .pptx are essentially ZIP archives containing many XML files.
                </blockquote>
                <p>If you rename a .docx file to .zip and extract it, you will find a collection of XML files.</p>

                <h2>2. Open Access – The Internet’s Own Boy</h2>
                <p>I learnt a lot from the problem discussed in this film, which I think is about the accessibility of research journal articles, which is also related to copyright issues.</p>
                <p>After watching the film and engaging in our class, my understanding now is that the copyright of the journal articles usually belong to the publishers (e.g. Elsevier, JSTOR). Am I right? Then the question is whether it is fair for the publishers to charge.</p>
                <p>The current inequality in access of knowledge for the public and scholars in educational institutions is because the publishers charge. Scholars in educational institutions having privilege is because the institutions have paid. However, I agree that we should find a better model for the society to give more equal access to knowledge to everyone.</p>
                <p>I know that some scholars use funding to pay for their publications to be open source. Beyond journal articles, I also have a concern about published books. Should published books be free to the public as well? What are the differences between published books and journal articles? Websites like Z-library are important for students who are frightened by the high prices of books, but many of them are illegal.</p>
                <p>As a consumer of intellectual resources, such as books, journals, music, films, I would prefer them to be free, and I would enjoy using special technical skills to obtain them, but I wouldn't dare to circulate them in fear of legal risks.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Digitisation in GLAM Section</h2>
                <p>The digitisation in GLAMs provides many benefits. For example, it helps with scholarly studies. In the past year, I have been obsessed with two research works by a group of visualisation (as a part of computer science) researchers.</p> 
                <p>Their works <em>OldVisOnline</em> and <em>ZuantuSet</em> retrieves images about historical visualisations from major digital collections around the world, and build them as a database. Their work targeted at the history of visualisation can be viewed in the discipline of history of science. Such works cannot be realistic without great digitisation works by the museums beforehand.</p>
