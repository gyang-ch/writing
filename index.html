            <article>
                <p class="intro">
                    This essay will discuss topics in the course DH6033. While
                    there are many Digital Humanities related concepts in the
                    course, I will focus on these three: TEI-XML and other text
                    encoding scenarios, the problems and controversy of open
                    access, and digitisation in the GLAM sector. They are either
                    of interest to me, or have a quite debatable situation.
                </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. TEI and XML</h2>
                    <p>
                        Markup languages are the tools we use to structure text
                        digitally. While HTML is all about how data looks on a
                        screen, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is designed to
                        store and transport data. It focuses on the meaning and
                        hierarchy of the text rather than its visual appearance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        XML is actually used everywhere in our digital lives,
                        even if we don't see it. For example, standard files
                        like <code>.docx</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>, and
                        <code>.pptx</code> are really just ZIP folders full of
                        XML files. If you rename a <code>.docx</code> file to
                        <code>.zip</code> and extract it, you can actually see
                        the collection of XML files that make up your document.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Digital Humanities, the Text Encoding Initiative
                        (TEI) is the main standard for using XML. However, there
                        are several other frameworks depending on what you are
                        trying to encode:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>EpiDoc</strong> – A version of TEI XML made
                            specifically for ancient documents like inscriptions
                            and papyri.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>MEI (Music Encoding Initiative)</strong> – A
                            community project that defines a TEI-like system for
                            encoding music notation.
                        </li>

                            – This isn't a markup language itself, but it’s a
                            standard that helps institutions share and present
                            high-quality images and manuscripts smoothly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong
                                >YAML / JSON for born-digital archives</strong

                            – These are lighter formats that machines can read
                            easily. Reimann et al. (2024) [cite_start][cite:
                            1664] argue that capturing born-digital data—like
                            online forum threads full of emojis and
                            upvotes—often needs custom schemas. These schemas
                            need to handle the nested, tree-like structure of
                            digital conversations, which traditional linear text
                            encoding struggles with.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Text mining corpora</strong> – These often
                            use "stand-off" annotation formats instead of
                            embedding TEI directly, which allows researchers to
                            add multiple layers of interpretation without
                            breaking the XML structure.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        TEI preserves scholarly nuance, but it is
                        labour-intensive, which means large-scale TEI projects
                        are more likely to be accomplished by well-resourced
                        institutions.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        It is also important to note that TEI isn't static; it
                        changes to meet new technical and social challenges.
                        Bauman et al. (2024) [cite_start][cite: 2161] point out
                        that maintaining the tools that process TEI (the ODD
                        processor) is technically difficult, leading to new
                        projects like "ATOP" that aim to rebuild these tools
                        from scratch. At the same time, the guidelines are
                        evolving to be more inclusive. Beshero-Bondar et al.
                        (2024) [cite_start][cite: 2460] describe recent updates
                        that move away from binary definitions of sex and
                        gender, allowing encoders to describe people in digital
                        editions in a way that is more culturally accurate.

                    <h2>2. Open Access – The Internet’s Own Boy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The documentary <em>The Internet’s Own Boy</em> is a
                        really strong introduction to the problems with how
                        academic knowledge is produced. It shows how copyright
                        laws often restrict access to journal articles. These
                        rights usually belong to companies like Elsevier and
                        JSTOR, not the people who actually did the work. This
                        raises a big ethical question: is it fair for publishers
                        to sell knowledge that was mostly paid for by public
                        funding and academic labour?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current system creates a divide. If you are part of
                        a well-funded university, you can access library
                        subscriptions easily. But the general public and
                        independent researchers are effectively locked out.
                        While moving towards Open Access tries to fix this, the
                        transition is complicated financially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, the "Gold Open Access" model, which often
                        relies on Article Processing Charges, might actually
                        create new unfairness. Papillon et al. (2019)
                        [cite_start][cite: 4133] argue that while this model
                        makes things readable for the public, it shifts the cost
                        to the author. This could exclude researchers in the
                        humanities and social sciences who don't have large
                        grants, as well as junior scholars and those in the
                        Global South. It risks becoming a "pay-to-publish"
                        system where only well-funded voices are heard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is also important to distinguish between different
                        types of scholarship. While journal articles don't
                        usually make money for their authors, books are
                        different. Monographs take years to write, and authors
                        often rely on royalties as part of their income. Because
                        of this, it is more ethically complicated to demand that
                        books should be free compared to journal articles.
                        However, academic books are so expensive that many
                        students resort to "shadow libraries" like Z-Library,
                        even though these sites exist in a legal grey area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The definition of what counts as a "research output"
                        also complicates things, especially in the GLAM sector.
                        [cite_start]Rees Koerner and Ackrell (2025) [cite: 5033]
                        note that while universities mostly produce text,
                        museums produce things like exhibitions, gallery labels,
                        and engagement activities. Traditional digital
                        repositories often can't handle these kinds of outputs
                        well, so we need new infrastructure to ensure museum
                        research is as open and accessible as university
                        research.

                        This creates a bit of a personal dilemma: as someone who
                        consumes intellectual resources, I love the immediate
                        access that digital platforms provide. But I am cautious
                        about supporting systems that might hurt authors
                        financially. These differences show that Open Access
                        can't just be one single model; books and
                        non-traditional outputs need their own sustainable
                        approaches that balance access with the economic reality
                        of producing them.

                    <h2>3. Digitisation in the GLAM sector</h2>
                    <p>
                        Digitisation in GLAMs provides many benefits. For
                        example, it really helps with research. Over the past
                        year, I have been very interested in two projects by
                        visualisation researchers: <em>OldVisOnline</em> and
                        <em>ZuantuSet</em>. They collect images of historical
                        visualisations from digital collections all over the
                        world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Zhang et al. (2023) note that historical visualisations
                        are often scattered across different libraries, museums,
                        and archives, and they all have different metadata. This
                        makes a unified dataset crucial for studying the history
                        of science. Furthermore, Mei et al. (2025) highlight a
                        big gap in digital humanities: the lack of non-Western
                        materials. Their <em>ZuantuSet</em> focuses specifically
                        on Chinese historical visualisations, challenging the
                        Eurocentric bias we often see in general datasets.

                    <p>
                        [cite_start]However, even after thirty years of
                        investment, only about 22% of heritage collections in
                        Europe are actually digitised (Terras, 2022)[cite: 79].
                        Even when objects are digitised, they can be hard to
                        find or use because of poor metadata. [cite_start]Lim
                        and Liew (2011) [cite: 4576] found that while many
                        institutions use basic standards like Dublin Core, the
                        lack of technical metadata and the reliance on
                        proprietary systems creates "silos." This means data
                        can't be easily shared or harvested. If the metadata
                        isn't compatible, these digitised items are basically
                        invisible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation itself uses a range of technical methods.
                        Traditional techniques include
                        <strong>2D scanning</strong> for flat objects like
                        manuscripts,
                        <strong>high‑resolution photography</strong> for
                        artworks, and <strong>multispectral imaging</strong> to
                        reveal faded text. More advanced projects use
                        <strong>photogrammetry</strong>, which builds 3D models
                        from photographs, or <strong>laser scanning</strong> to
                        create highly accurate 3D meshes of sculptures or
                        artefacts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While these technologies are impressive, they have
                        limitations. Tausch et al. (2019) [cite_start][cite:
                        5430] describe how difficult it is to automate 3D
                        digitization for large collections, especially for shiny
                        objects like gold which need special techniques. Also,
                        just because images exist doesn't mean they are easy to
                        use. Valeonti et al. (2019) [cite_start][cite: 3367]
                        note that many so-called "Open Access" museums still
                        provide low-resolution images or hide them behind long
                        download forms to track usage, which discourages people
                        from actually using them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation is often blocked by legal issues because
                        scanning an artwork counts as making a "copy" under
                        copyright law. GLAM institutions often can't digitise
                        works unless they can find and pay the copyright
                        holders. Because of this, institutions sometimes
                        prioritize items that are easy to clear legally rather
                        than what is culturally significant. [cite_start]Coad
                        (2019) [cite: 584] calls this the "digital skew." It
                        means our online cultural memory is full of older,
                        public domain works, while modern history remains hidden
                        behind copyright walls. [cite_start]This creates a
                        distorted view of history that doesn't accurately
                        reflect our recent past[cite: 582].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digitisation also enables
                        <strong>digital repatriation</strong>. This can be a
                        powerful tool for indigenous communities to access
                        cultural artefacts that cannot be physically returned to
                        them.

                        digitisation efforts undertaken by museums and cultural
                        institutions. However, we must remain critical of the
                        process, ensuring that digitisation efforts prioritize
                        data quality, interoperability, and legal frameworks
                        that allow for true accessibility, rather than creating
                        new digital silos.
